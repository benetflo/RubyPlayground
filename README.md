# Ruby Playground :)
Welcome to my Ruby Playground! This repository is a place where I experiment, learn, and have fun with Ruby programming. I've always wanted to dive deeper into Ruby, especially since I was a kid and used RPG Maker VX, which uses Ruby for scripting. Now, I'm using this repo to explore different ideas, small projects, and random Ruby experiments.
