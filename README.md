# Ruby Playground 💎
Welcome to my Ruby Playground! This repository is a place where I experiment, learn, and have fun with Ruby programming in my free time. I've always wanted to dive deeper into Ruby, especially since I was a kid and used RPG Maker VX, which uses Ruby for scripting. While I’ve never actually scripted in Ruby before, I've always been curious and excited to learn.

I’m starting with simple projects and gradually building up my skills as I go. This repo will feature a variety of small experiments, code snippets, and mini-projects as I continue to explore Ruby and grow my knowledge.
